# Hi, I'm Vaibhavi Gupta 👋 

Data Analyst |  Machine Learning | Curious about data & patterns  

I genuinely enjoy working with data — cleaning messy datasets, asking why numbers behave the way they do, and turning them into insights that make sense.  
Most of my work is in **data analytics**, and I also enjoy using **machine learning to make predictions and understand trends**.

What I enjoy:
- Finding patterns in data people usually miss  
- Building dashboards that clearly explain *what’s happening and why*  
- Using ML models for prediction and understanding, not just accuracy  

Tools:
SQL, Python, Excel | Tableau, Power BI | Statistics, EDA, Machine Learning  

Currently focused on improving 'analytics, data storytelling, and practical ML', one project at a time.


Always open to learning, feedback, and meaningful data projects.
