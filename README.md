# Hi, I'm Vaibhavi Gupta  

Data Analyst | Curious about data & patterns  

I genuinely enjoy working with data — cleaning messy datasets, asking why numbers behave the way they do, and slowly turning them into insights that actually make sense.  
Most of my work is around data analytics, and I also like experimenting with machine learning to make predictions and understand trends**.

What I enjoy doing:
- Exploring data to find patterns people usually miss  
- Building dashboards that clearly explain 'what’s happening and why'  
- Using ML models to predict outcomes, not just for accuracy but for understanding  
- Connecting data with real business or human behavior  

Tools I work with:
- SQL, Python, Excel  
- Tableau, Power BI  
- Statistics, EDA, Machine Learning  

Right now, I’m focused on getting better at analytics, storytelling with data, and practical ML, one project at a time.

Always open to learning, feedback, and meaningful data projects.
